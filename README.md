# RockPaperScissorsGame
this is just a simple game of rock, paper, and scissors, which allows the user to input an integer. 0 for rock, 1 for paper, and 2 for scissors. Then the program will print out a random corresponding number for the computer and decide who wins the game. The images of rock, paper and scissors were taken from the ASCII art website, and the codes were built by me.
